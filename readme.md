The original Rainbow Flag, introduced in 1978, was designed by Gilbert Baker, an American artist and gay rights activist. Commissioned by San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk, the flag debuted at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978. Baker, along with collaborators including Lynn Segerblom (also known as Faerie Argyle Rainbow) and James McNamara, hand-dyed and stitched the flag with the help of volunteers. The flag was conceived as a symbol of hope and liberation for the LGBTQ+ community, moving away from the negative connotations of previous symbols like the pink triangle. ([Architectural Digest][1], [Vogue][2], [GLBT Historical Society][3], [Wikipedia][4])

The original flag featured eight colored stripes, each with its own meaning:([GLBT Historical Society][3])

* **Hot Pink**: Sexuality
* **Red**: Life
* **Orange**: Healing
* **Yellow**: Sunlight
* **Green**: Nature
* **Turquoise**: Magic/Art
* **Indigo**: Serenity/Harmony
* **Violet**: Spirit([scholarblogs.emory.edu][5], [Dwell][6], [Wikipedia][7], [HISTORY][8], [Wikimedia][9])

The flag's composition was intended to represent the diversity and unity of the LGBTQ+ community, with each color symbolizing a different aspect of the human experience. The rainbow motif was chosen for its natural beauty and its association with hope and inclusivity.&#x20;

Due to production constraints, the flag underwent modifications:([Our Flags][10])

* In 1979, the hot pink stripe was removed because the fabric was not readily available.
* Later that year, the turquoise stripe was also dropped to allow for an even number of stripes when the flag was split to decorate both sides of street lamps along the parade route.([Wikipedia][7], [GLBT Historical Society][3])

These changes resulted in the six-color version commonly seen today: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. ([Wikipedia][7])

The Rainbow Flag has since become a globally recognized symbol of LGBTQ+ pride and rights, embodying the community's diversity, resilience, and unity.([GLBT Historical Society][3])
